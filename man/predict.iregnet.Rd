\title{Predict response using new covariates}
\usage{
\method{predict}{iregnet}(object, newx, lambda = NULL, type = c("link",
  "response"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The S3 object of type \code{iregnet} returned by the \link{iregnet}
method.}

\item{newx}{New input matrix of covariates with dimension n_vars same as used
for fit. Sparse matrices are not supported.}

\item{lambda}{The values of lambda at which prediction is to be obtained.
These should be a subset of the values on which the model was fit. To obtain
predictions at other lambda values, re-fit the model.
\cr \emph{Default: \code{NULL} (\code{object$lambda} is used)}}

\item{type}{Type of prediction required. Type \code{link} returns the linear
predictors. Type \code{response} returns the fitted values.
In the case of \code{gaussian}, \code{logistic} and
\code{extreme_value}, the link and response are the same.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments. Currently unused.}
}
\description{
Prediction is just X'beta for non-transformed distributions, and
itrans(X'beta) for transformed distributions.
In the case of \code{gaussian}, \code{logistic} and
\code{extreme_value}, types link and response both return the linear
predictors.
